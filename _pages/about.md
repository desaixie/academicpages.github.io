Hi! 
I am Desai Xie (Ë∞¢Âæ∑Ëµõ).
I am a 4th-year CS PhD student at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/), advised by [Prof. Arie Kaufman](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~ari/), who fosters an environment of interdisciplinary research in our lab. 
I was a research intern at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/) in Summer 2023, working with [Dr. Xin Sun](https://www.sunxin.name/) and [Dr. Hao Tan](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~airsplay/).
Prior to joining SBU, I spent 3 years at [Lehigh University](https://www2.lehigh.edu/) for my undergraduate CS education, where I worked on a protein volume classification project with [Prof. Brian Chen](https://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~chen/).

My research is driven by my passion for advancing the state of Generative AI through Reinforcement Learning (RL). 
This field has shown promising paths to superhuman intelligence (e.g. [AlphaZero](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphazero-shedding-new-light-on-chess-shogi-and-go/) and [OpenAI Five](https://openai.com/research/openai-five-defeats-dota-2-world-champions)).
Currently, I am interested in using RL to finetune large, pre-trained generative models (e.g. my Adobe research internship project [Carve3D](https://desaixie.github.io/carve-3d/)); pre-training provides great generalization and RL finetuning can unlock the full potential of the model by generating high-quality synthetic data from the pre-trained model itself.

Misc
=====
I love training my "Catificial" Intelligence/CatGPTüêà agent, **Purrari**, using a blend of supervised learning (instruction finetuning) and RL (treats as positive reward). 
She understood many words in both English and Mandarin and has mastered numerous tricks. 
Currently, she is advancing her communication skills through pet talking buttons. 
For more cute cat pics and videos, please visit [her instagram](https://www.instagram.com/purrari_0310/), lovingly maintained by her mom.
