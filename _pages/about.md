I am a 4th year CS PhD student at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/), advised by [Prof. Arie Kaufman](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~ari/), who encourages interdisciplinary research in the lab. 
I was a research intern at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/) in Summer 2023, working with [Dr. Xin Sun](https://www.sunxin.name/) and [Dr. Hao Tan](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~airsplay/).
Before coming to SBU, I spent 3 years at [Lehigh University](https://www2.lehigh.edu/) for my undergraduate CS education, where I worked on a protein volume classification project with [Prof. Brian Chen](https://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~chen/).

My research is driven by my passion for advancing the state of Generative AI through Reinforcement Learning (RL), as the field of RL has shown a promising path to superhuman intelligence (e.g. [AlphaZero](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphazero-shedding-new-light-on-chess-shogi-and-go/) and [OpenAI Five](https://openai.com/research/openai-five-defeats-dota-2-world-champions)).
Having employed RL finetuning on diffusion models for text-to-3D during the internship at Adobe, I am exploring RL's application on more models (e.g. transformers and state space models) and tasks (e.g. text-to-video and autonomous agents) that can be formulated as sequential decision-making problems.

Misc
=====
I love training my "Catificial" Intelligence/CatGPTüêà agent, **Purrari**, with supervised learning (instruction finetuning) and RL (treats as positive reward). 
She has mastered many tricks and learned to understand many words in English and Mandarin. 
She is currently learning to speak through pet talking buttons. 
For lots of cat pics and videos, please go to [her instagram](https://www.instagram.com/purrari_0310/), which is maintained by her mom who also took my profile picture on this page.
