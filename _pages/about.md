Hi! 
I am Desai Xie (Ë∞¢Âæ∑Ëµõ).
I am a 4th-year CS PhD student at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/), advised by [Prof. Arie Kaufman](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~ari/). 
I am interning in the Video AI group at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/) in Summer 2024, working on video generation with [Yang Zhou](https://yzhou359.github.io/) and [Prof. Feng Liu](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fliu/).
I was a research intern in the 3D group at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/) in Summer 2023, working with [Xin Sun](https://www.sunxin.name/) and [Hao Tan](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~airsplay/).
Prior to joining SBU, I spent 3 years at [Lehigh University](https://www2.lehigh.edu/) for my undergraduate CS education, where I worked on a protein volume classification project with [Prof. Brian Chen](https://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~chen/).

I am broadly interested in foundation models and sequential decision making.
So far, I have worked on large-scale pre-training and and finetuning of foundation models without real data, e.g. with the model's own generated data and feedback from another model ([Carve3D](https://desaixie.github.io/carve-3d/)) and with procedurally synthesized data ([LRM-Zero](https://desaixie.github.io/lrm-zero/)).
I strive to exercise the ideas from [the Bitter Lesson](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html) in my research projects.
The ultimate goal of my research is to develop self-improving AI systems, inspired by [AlphaZero](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphazero-shedding-new-light-on-chess-shogi-and-go/).

Misc
=====
A fun fact about my name is that De (Âæ∑) and Sai (Ëµõ) means demoncracy and science in Chinese ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Culture_Movement#Chen_Duxiu)).

I love training my "Catificial" Intelligence/CatGPTüêà agent, **Purrari**, using a blend of supervised learning (instruction finetuning) and RL (treats as positive reward). 
She understands many words in both English and Mandarin and has mastered numerous tricks. 
Currently, she is advancing her communication skills through pet talking buttons. 
For more cute cat pics and videos, please visit [her instagram](https://www.instagram.com/purrari_0310/), lovingly maintained by her mom.
