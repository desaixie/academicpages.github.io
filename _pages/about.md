Hi there! 
I am Desai Xie (Ë∞¢Âæ∑Ëµõ).
I am a 5th-year CS PhD candidate at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/), advised by [Prof. Arie Kaufman](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~ari/). 
I interned in the Video AI group at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/) in Summer 2024, working on video generation with [Yang Zhou](https://yzhou359.github.io/) and [Prof. Feng Liu](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fliu/).
I was a research intern in the 3D group at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/) in Summer 2023, working with [Xin Sun](https://www.sunxin.name/) and [Hao Tan](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~airsplay/).
Prior to joining SBU, I spent 3 years at [Lehigh University](https://www2.lehigh.edu/) for my undergraduate CS education, where I worked on protein volume classification with [Prof. Brian Chen](https://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~chen/).

I am broadly interested in visual generative models, large-scale training, and Reinforcment Learning (RL).
In my research, I often take a **scalability** perspective (e.g. [the Bitter Lesson](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html)): 
- [Progressive Autoregressive Video Diffusion Models](https://desaixie.github.io/pa-vdm/) introduces a new noise schedule and sampling algorithm that seamlessly model long videos with regular context length; otherwise, long videos are computationally infeasible to diffusion modeling directly.
- [Carve3D](https://desaixie.github.io/carve-3d/) uses RL with feedback from 3D reconstruction to circumvent real 3D data
- [LRM-Zero](https://desaixie.github.io/lrm-zero/) introduces large-scale procedural 3D data synthesis to address 3D data scarcity.

News
======
I am seeking intern and full-time research opportunities in 2025, with flexible starting dates and durations.
Please reach out if you have any openings!

**2024/10/10** [Progressive Autoregressive Video Diffusion Models](https://desaixie.github.io/pa-vdm/) is released on arXiv! Proud to build the first video generation model that can autoregressively generate 60-second videos without quality degradation over time!

**2024/09/25** [LRM-Zero](https://desaixie.github.io/lrm-zero/) is accepted at [NeurIPS 2024](https://neurips.cc/)! 

**2024/06/17** Attended [CVPR 2024](https://cvpr.thecvf.com/Conferences/2024) in Seattle, WA. I presented [Carve3D](https://desaixie.github.io/carve-3d/) and was glad to see [LRM-Zero](https://desaixie.github.io/lrm-zero/) being featured in two workshop invited talks ([3DFM](https://3dfm.github.io/) and [SyntaGen](https://syntagen.github.io/)) by [Hao Tan](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~airsplay/) and [Nathan Carr](https://research.adobe.com/person/nathan-carr/)!

**2024/06/13** [LRM-Zero](https://desaixie.github.io/lrm-zero/) is released on arXiv! First time working on large-scale pre-training and data generation, and it was a blast!

**2024/05/28** Started my second internship at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/), this time working on video generation!

**2024/02/26** Excited to share that [Carve3D](https://desaixie.github.io/carve-3d/) is accepted at [CVPR 2024](https://cvpr.thecvf.com/Conferences/2024)! 

**2023/07/17** [GAIT](https://desaixie.github.io/gait-rl/) is accepted at [ICCV 2023](https://iccv2023.thecvf.com/)! 

**2023/06/19** Started my internship at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/)!

Misc
=====
A fun fact about my name is that De (Âæ∑) and Sai (Ëµõ) means demoncracy and science in Chinese ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Culture_Movement#Chen_Duxiu)).

I love training my "Catificial" Intelligence/CatGPTüêà agent, **Purrari**, using a blend of supervised learning (instruction finetuning) and RL (treats as positive reward). 
She understands many words in both English and Mandarin and has mastered numerous tricks. 
Currently, she is advancing her communication skills through pet talking buttons. 
For more cute cat pics and videos, please visit [her instagram](https://www.instagram.com/purrari_0310/), lovingly maintained by her mom.
